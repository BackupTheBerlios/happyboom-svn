============

Hachoir is a library written in Python to access binary streams using
nice API. It aims to be easy to use (hide complex mechanisms) and only read
or compute data when it's really needed.

Examples of Hachoir use: extract some informations from a file (size of an
image, author of a music, comment of an archive, etc.), edit some fields of
a file, convert a format to another one.
