    o Create EnumChunk: associate a string to a key (useful in a lot of
      binary formats)
    o Create BitsChunks: it's now possible to split bytes in bits (useful
      for 'flags' fields)
    o Use new syntax for all plugins: only use read() and doRead() methods,
      new FormatChunk syntax (eg. "uint16" instead of "<H"), use OnDemandFilter
      instead of Filter class (Filter was removed)
    o Improve plugins display result using updateParent()
    o Lot of small bugfixes in plugins
    o Clean code (remove old useless code)
    o Disable all operations (create / delete / edit) on filters and chunks

    o Some speed up:
      - use more caches (eg. for format operations like getting format size)
      - merge FormatChunkCache and FormatChunk to limit function calls
    o New command line options: "--use-profiler" and "--debug"
    o Hide backtrace by default (need "--debug" command line option)
    o Delete ArrayFilter class, replace it with classical while Python
      structure.
    o Add "copy to clipboard" in user interface
    o Add AVI (written with a new author, AurÃ©lien Jacobs), MP3, ID3, MBR,
      EXT2, PCX, BMP, WORMS2 plugins. RPM plugin can now read all headers
      and also file content.
    o Kill arbitrary limits (address/size) ;-) (in Chunk/Filter classes and in UI)
    o Don't support FormatChunk dynamic format (like "{size}s"),
      nor "@end@" keyword anymore
    o Start work on "on demand filter": create OnlyFormatsChunkFilter class
      which only instanciate objects when needed. It's only used
      in EXT2 plugin yet.
