- Compiler GNU g++
  http://gcc.gnu.org/
- GTK 2.x (version 2.6 or greater?) and development headers of GTK+

  make

Last step ("make install") should be run by the root user. If you are not the
administrator on your station, you can still install the plugin in your home 
directory ("$HOME/.gimp-2.2/plug-ins/"):
  gimptool --install-bin src/greycstoration

Instruction to compile SVN sources

Prior to running the above described commands, you must create the "configure"
script by running this command:
  ./autogen.sh

This requires that you have installed some recent enough versions of GNU 
autotools (tested with autoconf-1.9.6 and automake-2.59).
